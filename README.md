## Synopsis

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**

A C++ implementation of the MD4 hashing function which allows the specification of the round and operation steps.  

## Motivation

This MD4 hashing algorithm is an attempt at recreating [Wang's](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11426639_1) collision attack on MD4.

## Tests

Reference strings and output hashes can be found in RFC1320.

## TO-DO

* Break into separate files

* Simplify embeddability for other projects

* Start working on Wang's attack
